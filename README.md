# Machine Learning Track
Machine Learning can go beyond just predicting creditand dive into fairness, accessibility, and social impact. Your team can explore how AI can be used to create fairer systems and help MSMEs in underserved communities access better opportunities.

## Problem Statements
- Equity-Based Lending Models: How can we design machine learning models that incorporate non-financial factors (e.g., community impact, social responsibility) into lending decisions, making MSMEs who are typically marginalized or deemed high-risk more eligible for credit?

- Inclusive Financial Products: How can machine learning help banks develop new financial products tailored to MSMEs that are underbanked, such as small farming cooperatives or social enterprises, taking into account seasonal cash flows and long-term sustainability?

## Implemented Solution
### Project LEAVES: Loan Payment Evaluation and Recommender System for MSMEs via A.I for Economic Sustainability
A dual pipeline backend model for predicting loan amount, bank tenure, and interest rate. Project L.E.A.V.E.S. aims to provide MSMEs better access to loans from financial institutions with a manageable payment plan. To extend loan eligibility opportunities, Project L.E.A.V.E.S. will specifically fulfill the following: Cater to MSME clients â€“ both returning loan customers and customers who are new to bank loans; and suggest an appropriate loan amount offered to MSMEs utilizing machine learning algorithms.
