# Machine Learning Track
Machine Learning can go beyond just predicting creditand dive into fairness, accessibility, and social impact. Your team can explore how AI can be used to create fairer systems and help MSMEs in underserved communities access better opportunities.

## Problem Statements
- Equity-Based Lending Models: How can we design machine learning models that incorporate non-financial factors (e.g., community impact, social responsibility) into lending decisions, making MSMEs who are typically marginalized or deemed high-risk more eligible for credit?

- Inclusive Financial Products: How can machine learning help banks develop new financial products tailored to MSMEs that are underbanked, such as small farming cooperatives or social enterprises, taking into account seasonal cash flows and long-term sustainability?
